# Jogha Family Tree

Jogha is my DnD character and he loves singing songs about his "amazing" Goblin lineage, but Goblins tend to breed like rabbits. So instead of writing down hundreds of Goblin names. I built this generator to generate names during these Dnd sessions.

Everyone in Jogha family has a 'Jo' in the name. It's intention.
